# Hey, I'm Frank MacBride

Full-stack software engineer. Four years at General Motors, Level 6. Laid off December 2025, currently looking.

At some point I spent several weeks modernizing a 500K-line codebase -- Java, Spring Boot, Angular -- that wasn't my project and wasn't in the backlog. I requested the user stories in standup so there'd be a paper trail. Nobody asked me to do any of it. It just felt like it should be done.

Atlanta-based. Remote or hybrid -- I'll put pants on sometimes.

## What I've Been Building Since December

### [jobContextMCP](https://github.com/JustLikeFrank3/jobContextMCP)
Started because Copilot kept asking me to reintroduce myself every session. Turned into a 30-tool MCP server with resume generation, cover letter PDF export, rejection tracking, STAR story engine, RAG semantic search across all my materials, outreach drafting in my actual voice, and a daily digest that tells me who I haven't followed up with.

490 people cloned it. I'm still a little surprised by that.

Not a product. Not a startup idea. A tool I built because I needed it — and apparently so did a few hundred other people.

### [RetrosPiCam](https://github.com/JustLikeFrank3/RetrosPiCam)
IoT camera system built in 6 days to see if I could coordinate hardware, mobile, and cloud in one system. FastAPI + React Native iOS + Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W + servo HAT + Azure Blob Storage + Tailscale VPN + APNs push notifications. Shipped to TestFlight.

Turns out I could.

### [LiveVoxNative](https://github.com/JustLikeFrank3/LiveVoxNative)
React Native + Swift AVAudioEngine. **12.7ms round-trip latency** on a physical iPhone. When I say I pick up new stacks fast, this is what I mean.

### [LiveVox](https://github.com/JustLikeFrank3/LiveVox)
Web Audio API. **2.8ms latency**. React 19 + TypeScript. Same story.

## A Note on the Name

`JustLikeFrank3` means two things.

I'm the third Frank Vladimir MacBride. My grandfather was the first. He started at a Ford dealership in Philadelphia in 1930 -- sixteen years old, Depression-era, ten cents an hour. By nineteen he was service manager. He kept it for fifty years.

Growing up I knew his shop the way a kid knows a place -- I was there, I knew the people, I knew what he did. What I didn't know was who he was to the people who worked alongside him.

I found that out around 33, after he'd died, when I rode my first Harley out to see Mr. Barlow. Somewhere in the visit, he told me that me pulling up on a Harley was a flashback -- my father used to do the same.

There's a 1933 photograph in my home office now. I took it with my iPhone that day. Four men in white service coats. My grandfather's is the cleanest.

I think about that whenever I'm asked to describe my work ethic.

The `JustLikeFrank` part comes from a Less Than Jake song introduced to me by my friend Sean Evans -- the most authentically himself person I've ever met. Lust for life, no pretense, no performance. Some people just stick with you.
