# Hey, I'm Frank MacBride

Full-Stack Software Engineer. 4 years at General Motors, Level 6, building systems that had to work.

I'm the kind of engineer who restores a CI/CD pipeline broken for three years not because it was my ticket, but because it was blocking everyone. Who takes on a 500K-line legacy codebase solo because someone had to. Who couldn't sleep the week our team got Copilot access because I wanted to fix everything and kept finding more things.

Currently looking. Atlanta-based, remote preferred.

## What I've Been Building Since December

### [jobContextMCP](https://github.com/JustLikeFrank3/jobContextMCP)
Started because Copilot kept asking me to reintroduce myself every session. Turned into a 30-tool MCP server with resume generation, cover letter PDF export, rejection tracking, STAR story engine, RAG semantic search across all my materials, outreach drafting in my actual voice, and a daily digest that tells me who I haven't followed up with.

490 people cloned it. I'm still a little surprised by that.

Not a product. Not a startup idea. A tool I built because I needed it — and apparently so did a few hundred other people.

### [RetrosPiCam](https://github.com/JustLikeFrank3/RetrosPiCam)
IoT camera system built in 6 days to see if I could coordinate hardware, mobile, and cloud in one system. FastAPI + React Native iOS + Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W + servo HAT + Azure Blob Storage + Tailscale VPN + APNs push notifications. Shipped to TestFlight.

Turns out I could.

### [LiveVoxNative](https://github.com/JustLikeFrank3/LiveVoxNative)
React Native + Swift AVAudioEngine. **12.7ms round-trip latency** on a physical iPhone. When I say I pick up new stacks fast, this is what I mean.

### [LiveVox](https://github.com/JustLikeFrank3/LiveVox)
Web Audio API. **2.8ms latency**. React 19 + TypeScript. Same story.

## A Note on the Name

`JustLikeFrank3` means two things.

I'm the third Frank Vladimir MacBride. My grandfather was the first. He started working at a Ford dealership in Philadelphia in 1930 -- sixteen years old, in the teeth of the Depression, making ten cents an hour. By nineteen he was service manager. He kept that for fifty years.

I didn't fully understand what that meant until I was around 33 -- after he'd died -- when I rode my first Harley out to visit his old shop. The owner told me things about my grandfather I'd never heard. I took a photo with my iPhone that day: four men, 1933, three in white service coats. My grandfather's is the cleanest.

I didn't know what to do with any of that until I was in the workforce myself.

The `JustLikeFrank` part comes from a Less Than Jake song introduced to me by my friend Sean Evans -- the most authentically himself person I've ever met. Lust for life, no pretense, no performance. Some people just stick with you.
