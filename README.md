# Hey, I'm Frank MacBride

Full-Stack Software Engineer. 4 years at General Motors, Level 6, building systems that had to work.

I'm the kind of engineer who restores a CI/CD pipeline broken for three years not because it was my ticket, but because it was blocking everyone. Who takes on a 500K-line legacy codebase solo because someone had to. Who couldn't sleep the week our team got Copilot access because I wanted to fix everything and kept finding more things.

Currently looking. Atlanta-based, remote preferred.

Started because Copilot kept asking me to reintroduce myself every session. Turned into a 30-tool MCP server with resume generation, cover letter PDF export, rejection tracking, STAR story engine, RAG semantic search across all my materials, outreach drafting in my actual voice, and a daily digest that tells me who I haven't followed up wit# Hey, I'm Frank MacBride
